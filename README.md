# Demolition Man

This project implements the demolition man in the Java programming language and the Processing library, done 
as part of the INFO1113 Objected Oriented Programming course at the University of Sydney. The aim of the game

Those who choose a more aggresive route may place bombs to destroy their enemies. This project received a mark of 14.5/15
in semester 2 of 2021.
