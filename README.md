# Demolition Man

This project implements the demolition man in the Java programming language and the Processing library, done 
as part of the INFO1113 Objected Oriented Programming course at the University of Sydney. The aim of the game
is for the player to get from the starting spawn point to the end of a level within a set time limit
whilst avoiding obstacles and enemies. Those who choose a more aggresive route may place bombs to destroy their enemies.  

This project includes the following features
1. Players can create and load their own custom level files to play.
2. Animated sequences for player and enemies, as well as bomb explosions
3. Full JUnit testcase suite achieving 90%+ code coverage over overall code and branches

This project received a mark of 14.5/15 in semester 2 of 2021.
